## 🎯 GOAL
The Goal was to make a portfolio website to to present myself and show my work, with a modern and elegant design.

## 🖌️ UI
I choose an unusual color palette based on : `##00a1a6`, `#093132` and `#222222`.
I played with the shadows and the blue like the day and night in a strange but soothing atmosphere.

## 🔩 UX
Knowing that my site would not be mainstream, but rather oriented for people comfortable with computers, I chose to sacrifice some accessibility for the benefit of UI design.
However, I try to give the user a smooth, pleasant and easily understandable navigation experience with all the informations scrolling on a single page.

## ⚙️ BACKEND
A very simple PHP backend, with two database : one for the pojects showcase, and the other for the conact form.
